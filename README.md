# Statistical Learning Code examples.
This repo contains some basic examples of conducting statistical learning in R. A useful code cheat sheet is also included that outlines some key statistical learning concepts including: 
1) Linear regression 
2) Logistic regression 
3) Linear Discriminant Analysis 
4) Variable Selection (forward, backwards, regular subset) 
5) Validation and Cross Validation 
6) Regularization using Lasso and Ridge 
7) KNN 
8) Tree based methods 
9) Random forest bagging and boosting trees 
10) Support vector machines 
11) Neural Networks 

The 2 page summary is a great study guide or cheatsheet for exams.

An online version of the R code which covest all the above topics can be found [here](https://chrismaree.github.io/RSupervisedLearningCheatsheet/CommonCodeExamples.html) ðŸš€
